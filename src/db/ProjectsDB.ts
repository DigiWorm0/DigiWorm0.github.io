            <p>VEXBridge is a communications library that synchronizes a key-value table across a serial connection. It handles all packet frames, byte stuffing, serialization/deserialization, ack/nack, and packet retransmission. In addition, it provides a web UI using React and Socket.IO to view values in realtime including live charts and a field map for rendering the current path/pose.</p>
            <p>It is primarily used for debugging autonomous routines for VEX-U robotics competitions as well as communicating data from a 3rd-party microcontroller (such as a Raspberry Pi) to the VEX V5 brain for the purpose of vision tracking w/ OpenCV.</p>
            <p>In addition, we designed a <a href="https://github.com/UWST-Robotics/VEXBridge-PCB">custom PCB</a> to handle power and serial communication on VEX's proprietary V5 connection. It provides conversion from RS-485 to RS-232, 5V power regulation, and LED indicators for power and traffic.</p>`,

Players can browse and explore community creations through the <a href="https://levelimposter.net/#/maps">LevelImposter website</a>.</p>
            <p>What started as a small personal project grew into a community of nearly 2,000 map creators, with over 50,000 map downloads, and millions of impressions on YouTube and Twitch.

            <p>As a result, I developed a UserScript called TDXWizard to add automation tools, significant UI improvements, and suggested actions based on common IT tickets. In addition, it provides customizability for any technicians to adjust their own instance.</p>`,

            <p>It was originally designed to minimize the initial loading times and memory overhead of libraries such as ImageSharp by lazily loading each frame of the GIF animation as-needed much like a web browser. After it loads each frame, the sprite is moved over to video memory so it doesn't occupy any space on the heap.</p>`,
